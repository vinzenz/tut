TASKS
    1. minimal dwarf_unwind to c++
    2. get function paramters automaticly from dwarf information

WORKING
    1. unwind to prev stack frame -> unw_resume 
    2. unwind on many platforms -> libunwind
    3. function parameters -> by hand ;) -> elf+dwarf

NOT WORKING
    3. getting result -> dwarf (to be done -> it's possible and shouldn't be very hard)

PROBLEMS
    1. if parameters were be extracted then run function with this parameters still will be problem without using asm and push etc.
        e.g.
            func(1,3,2);

        cyg_enter...
            get_dwarf_parameters -> 1,3,2
            stub_function_pointer

    solution:
        1. templates with call(...) function
        2. templates with parameters for e.g 1-15 (what whan function have 100 paramters ^:
        3. table with pointers and some class to run function with parameters saved in table
        4. other solutions
        5. bullitin (gcc) -> have some possibilities

        -> this for sure can be done without using asm :]
