Requirements:
	ctags.sourceforge.net

Options:
	-one testcases per class
	-for every functions
	-stubs (file -> tut_stubs.cpp)
	-dir (for test)
	-regular expressions to choose which functions for classes which for all functions
	-path(diff) for structure
	-if commentet tests
	-update (if some changes were done)
	-files(or recursive)	

	diff -crB tut_runner.hpp tut_runner2.hpp > tut_runner.patch
	#patch -p0 < tut.patch

	g++ -nostdinc
	g++ options ->parameter

	better: tutgen.cfg instead of parameters

stub for every file with the same include -> in dir tut_stubs
+ 1 file with includes

1. parse file for includes
2.

!! include parse file

for e.g. to main.h

#include "..src/main.h"

<<stub>>

Problem:

    g++ -o main.hpp -I/bla/other/direcotory


Problem:
    Return value ??
